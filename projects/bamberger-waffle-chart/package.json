  "description": "This component can be used to create simple waffle charts. The color or background image of a category can be customized. The area of the entire waffle chart and one waffle must be defined. The real numbers of every category are the inputs. No need for a pre-processing. The component calculates the ratio for every category and displays the results optimally. It must be ensured that the defined size of a waffle fits into the defined size of the entire waffle chart.",
